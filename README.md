This one-question SurveyMonkey survey was conducted during May 2018. It was sent to the 14 Pediatric ICU attending physcians and the 9 Pediatric ICU advanced practice providers with at least 3 years of experience at Children's Hospital Colorado.

This repository is the public archive of the survey.

A clinical decision support (CDS) tool might, for every patient in the ICU with a natural airway, continuously predict the probability of being intubated during that ICU stay.

This question does not qualify as Human Subjects Research according to the Office of Human Research Protections.
