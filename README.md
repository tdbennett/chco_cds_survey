This one-question SurveyMonkey survey was conducted at the Children's Hospital Colorado Pediatric ICU in May 2018 and at the UCHealth Medical ICU in January 2019. It was sent to all attending physcians and the experienced advanced practice providers at each institution who would be likely to make decisions about intubation in critically ill patients.

This repository is the public archive of the survey.

"A clinical decision support (CDS) tool might, for every patient in the ICU with a natural airway, continuously predict the probability of being intubated during that ICU stay.

This question does not qualify as Human Subjects Research according to the Office of Human Research Protections."

    Please rate your agreement with this statement:

"If it was accurate, the CDS tool described above would be clinically useful."
